Implementation Release
We are committed to supporting the academic and professional community by sharing our resources and tools. To this end, we plan to publicly release the implementation of the Raformer model once our accompanying research paper is officially accepted for publication.

Upcoming Availability
The source code, including detailed documentation and usage examples, will be made available here on this GitHub repository. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive toolkit that researchers and practitioners can use to further explore, experiment, and extend the capabilities of video wire inpainting technology.
